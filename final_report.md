# Battle of the Neighborhoods

## Introduction
The target audience for this project is a person who wants to move to or visit a new city in switzerland and wants to know how similar the city is to one they already know.
There are many relatively obvious features like size of the city or proximity to mountains or a lake that a person can easily take into account themselves.
The analysis focuses on similarity in terms of the types of venues in the cities since this is not so easily acessible without analyzing the data or visiting the city.

## Data
The data are a list of cities from switzerland from Wikipedia to get the all towns in switzerland with a population of over 10000 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Switzerland).
Then the foursquare API is used to get a list of venues for each city.
